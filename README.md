# AI-Powered Financial Portfolio Optimization üöÄ

Welcome to the AI-Powered Financial Portfolio Optimization project! This repository contains an advanced solution for optimizing financial portfolios using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.

## üí° Project Overview

This project leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the process of portfolio management. Using historical stock market data and real-time analysis, the model predicts optimal trading actions (Buy, Hold, or Sell) based on the portfolio‚Äôs current state. The goal is to maximize the portfolio‚Äôs value over time while minimizing risk.

The system uses:
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for reinforcement learning
- Tkinter for creating a dynamic, user-friendly GUI
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- PyTorch for building and training the model

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. AI-Based Portfolio Optimization
- The model makes decisions on whether to buy, hold, or sell assets in the portfolio based on historical data and real-time observations.
- Optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art RL algorithm.

### 2. Live Data Integration
- Fetches live financial data (like stock prices and daily flow) and makes predictions at real-time intervals (every 30 seconds).
- Visualizes real-time updates of portfolio performance.

### 3. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Tkinter is used to create a responsive, interactive dashboard that shows live data, portfolio performance, and allows users to control the model.
- The GUI includes:
  - Start, Stop, and Pause buttons
  - Live Data display
  - Action (Buy, Hold, or Sell) updates
  - Portfolio NAV (Net Asset Value) graph over time
  - Summary Analysis after each data update

### 4. Performance Reporting
- Every 30 minutes, the system generates a PDF report summarizing the portfolio's performance and growth trends.
- PDF includes analysis of stock actions, NAV changes, and overall performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - PyTorch for machine learning models
  - Tkinter for GUI
  - Matplotlib for data visualization
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - PDF generation for report creation
- **Algorithms**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Other Tools**: Git, PDF generation libraries

## üìä How It Works

### Data Collection:
- The project starts by loading historical financial data and real-time updates (e.g., stock prices, shares outstanding, daily flow).

### Training the Model:
- The PPO reinforcement learning model is trained on historical data to predict optimal actions (Buy, Hold, or Sell).

### Real-time Optimization:
- Once trained, the model predicts optimal actions based on live data (every 30 seconds).
- The portfolio‚Äôs performance is visualized through a graph showing changes in NAV over time.

### GUI Interaction:
- Users can start, pause, or stop the model via a simple button interface.
- The GUI dynamically updates to show real-time data and actions.

### Performance Reporting:
- After 30 minutes, a detailed performance report is generated, providing a summary of the portfolio's actions, growth, and overall performance.
